# Movie Management System (Python)

This is a simple command-line application created as part of an Introduction to Python course. It allows users to manage movies, users, and movie borrowings using JSON files.

## Features

- Add new users
- View existing users
- Add new movies
- View available movies
- Borrow movies
- Return movies
- List borrowed movies for a selected user

## Project Structure

- 'main.py' - main application logic and menu
- 'project_users.json' - stores users data
- 'project_movies.json' - stores movies data and available copies
- 'borrowings.json' - stores information about borrowed movies

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Clone this repository or download the files
3. Open a terminal in the project folder
4. Run the application using:

    ```bash
    python main.py

## What I learned

- Working with JSON files in Python
- Reading and writing data to files
- Creating functions and organizing code
- Handling user input in a command-line applikation
- Building a simple menu-driven program

## Notes

The application logic was developed collaboratively during the course. The repository structure, cleanup, and documentation were later prepared individually for learning and portfolio presentation.
